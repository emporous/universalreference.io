Emporous is a smart proxy that enables users to tag, query, and index files, including, but not limited to, security-related information, such as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) data. While Emporous is not specifically designed for managing CVEs, its ability to tag and query files makes it a versatile tool for improving the security of an organization's software supply chain. In this post, we will compare Emporous to other popular tools in the software supply chain security space, including Tidelift and Guac, and explore how Emporous can be used to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities in software artifacts.

When it comes to comparing Emporous to registries, it's important to note that they serve different purposes. Registries, such as the Open Container Initiative (OCI) artifact registry, are primarily used for storing and distributing software artifacts, while Emporous is used for tagging and managing security information related to those artifacts. Emporous can be used in conjunction with a registry, where the artifacts are stored and retrieved, but the primary focus is on security and vulnerability management.

Tidelift is a subscription-based service that provides organizations with a wide range of features to improve their software supply chain security. The Tidelift Subscription includes features such as dynamic Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation, visibility into transitive dependencies, and human-researched metadata to drive informed decision making. Tidelift also provides organizations with a centralized decision engine to drive consistent development practices and improve governance.

Guac, short for Graph for Understanding Artifact Composition, is a tool that aggregates software security metadata into a high-fidelity graph database. Guac helps organizations to better understand the relationships between their software artifacts and their metadata and identities. Guac can be used to drive higher-level organizational outcomes such as audit, policy, risk management, and even developer assistance.

Emporous is a client library that provides a range of capabilities for managing the security and integrity of software artifacts. While it is not specifically designed for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) management, Emporous allows users to tag files with security-related information and can be used to enforce policies, identify vulnerabilities and prevent the use of untrustworthy libraries and packages. In comparison, while Tidelift and Guac also offer a range of features to improve software supply chain security, they do not have the same specific focus on security and vulnerability management as Emporous.
