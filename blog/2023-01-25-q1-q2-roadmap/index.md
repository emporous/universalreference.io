In Q1 and Q2 of 2023, the Emporous project plans to expand on the capabilities of the Emporous Client go library and CLI to include: 

**Links by attribute:** This feature will allow users to link OCI artifacts by attribute. Links by attribute is a powerful alternative to the Client's current immmutable link by digest capability. 
**Complex attributes:** Users will be able to add more complex attribute values, such as arrays and objects, to their artifacts.
**Search Domains:** This will enable the Emporous Client to search across multiple registries and follow links across registries. 
**Deployment Records:** This feature will allow users to save their queries with all links, including transitive dependencies, resolved as immutable references. 
**Enhanced SigStore integration:** This will enable non-interactive signing with the CLI and expose more Cosign options.
**Standard SBOM formats:** This feature adds support for SPDX and CycloneDX. 

We are excited to share these features with you in the first half of this year. Follow along for project updates, releases, and other community content at https://emporous.io/blog.
